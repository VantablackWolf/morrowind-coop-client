[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)
=======
The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/?milestone_title=openmw-1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release, however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

As of version 0.8.1, TES3MP is fully playable, providing very extensive player, NPC, world and quest synchronization, as well as state saving and loading, all of which are highly customizable via [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts).

Remaining gameplay problems mostly relate to AI and the fact that clientside script variables need to be placed on a synchronization whitelist to avoid packet spam.

TES3MP now also has a [VR branch](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/tree/0.8.1-vr) that combines its code with that of Mads Buvik Sandvei's [OpenMW VR](https://gitlab.com/madsbuvi/openmw).

Contributing
---------------

Helping us with documentation, bug hunting and video showcases is always greatly appreciated.

For code contributions, it's best to start out with modestly sized fixes and features and work your way up. There are so many different possible implementations of more major features – many of which would cause undesirable code or vision conflicts with OpenMW – that those should be talked over in advance with the existing developers before effort is spent on them.
